# Flying Boats
## The boats fly
### Crafting:
Boat in the bottom-middle slot, then a coal block in the center slot
#### Usage:
It moves in the direction the boat is facing. Just spam space bar and it'll zoom in that direction (F3 + B helps). The boats will fall when you don't spam space bar, and you don't need to hold down WASD, so you can aim bows/combat if you somehow manage to aim that well

<sub> also they explode when they get shot and the hitbox is really big </sub>
